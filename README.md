# 🎮 List of Games: • War • Tic-Tac-Toe • Blackjack • Craps • Hangman

This repository contains simple implementations of five classic games written in C++.
The goal of this project is to practice fundamental programming concepts such as logic design, condition handling, loops, and modular programming with .cpp and .h files.

# 📂 Games Included

🃏 War – A card game where two players draw cards and the higher card wins.

❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe – The timeless two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid.

♠️♥️ Blackjack – The casino card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

🎲 Craps – A dice game where rolling a 7 or 11 wins instantly, and rolling a 2, 3, or 12 loses.

🔤 Hangman – A word-guessing game where players try to discover the hidden word before the stick figure is completed.

# 🚀 Features

Playable directly from the console/terminal.

Turn-based game logic with clear win/lose/draw conditions.

Uses modular structure with .cpp and .h files.

Beginner-friendly code for learning and modification.

# ▶️ How to Run
